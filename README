I got a hold of Liam's radiance to BT code, and ran it through f2py to make 
the python module mod_br.so

I have included the commands I ran in f2py_commands.txt. The first generates 
the mod_br.pyf file... 

	f2py modis_bright.f bright_m.f brite_m.f -m mod_br -h mod_br.pyf --overwrite-signature

which you then edit to put in the "intent" statments in 
the variable declarations. The second command generates the module file...

	f2py -c mod_br.pyf modis_bright.f bright_m.f brite_m.f

I ended up inlining the included code, and removing Liam's common block. f2py 
doesn't seem to know what to do with included code (or I don't know the f2py 
command to do it properly).

The main function is modis_bright(radiance,platform,band,units). Check 
modis_bright.f for the definitions. But for platform, 0==Terra, 1==Aqua

This is how I used the module...

from mod_br import *
from scipy import *

modis_bright(12.,1,31,1)
Out[16]: 316.25592041015625

In [17]: radiance = linspace(5.,12.,10)

In [18]: modBT = vectorize(modis_bright)

In [19]: brightTempsAqua = modBT(radiance,1,31,1)

In [20]: print brightTempsAqua
